# On my way to neovim

From sublime text, to VSCode and finally neovim. I'm here to tell you why I
switched editors, how many of them I tested and what I could find about them.
Finally, I'll give you another reason to switch to neovim among the thousands
you've probably heard from people like TeeJ or ThePrimeagen (greetings, cult
leaders).

! Props to TeeJ and ThePrimeagen
